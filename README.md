There is no api key in this project heres how you can fetch your own
Make a .env file in the "ROOT FOLDER" not in src
go to https://api.nasa.gov/
You'll see "Generate API key" fill your details
create a variable in .env file with prefix REACT_APP
eg REACT_APP_NASA_API_KEY=(API key in your email) (dont put any gap between "=" sign)
you are all set for the api use

use "npm install" wait for node_modules to get installed
use "npm start" make sure you are in same directory as your project is in
